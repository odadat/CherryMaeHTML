<section>
    <p>I am Cherry Mae P. Caguindangan, 23 years.
       Living in Dela Paz Liloy Zamboanga del Norte
       and recently studying at Jose Rizal Memorial State University Tampilisan Campus.
       I like to play volleyball, travel everywhere, making friends but I hate fake friends 
       that's why I dont have a bestfriends.I am the kind of woman that is soft-hearted,
       easily trust and also trusted. When I was young my parents broke up and my mother
       is the only one raise me. I experience eating roots crops like camote, gabi, cassava and
       many more because we dont have money to buy rice else corn. I finish my elementary education
       and High School at Raba, Godod Zamboanga del Norte and graduated as second honorable mention.
       In year 2017, I move to Liloy Zamboanga del Norte to finish my Senior High School Education
       and also graduated there in year 2019. My life wans't easy but in my daily activities I
       always trust our Almighty God.
